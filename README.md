# Character Conversational AI with Voice Cloning

##### ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**

- **Current focus**: Developing a single-agent conversational AI tailored for Japanese.
- **Ongoing efforts**: Optimizing loading and inference speeds.

This project aims to build a multi-agent conversational AI for characters. Allowing users to interact with them or observe the interaction between characters.
